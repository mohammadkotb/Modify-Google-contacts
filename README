Modify Google Contacts is a simple python script to modify Mobile Numbers in
your Google contacts (for Egyptian Mobile Numbers after migrating from 10 to
11 digits).

To use this script:
1) Export your Google contacts in a csv file format
2) Run the python script in terminal by passing the csv file to the arguments
  - You may not pass the input file to the script in case of naming the file 
    'google.csv' and it is located in the same directory of the script
  - Also you can pass as a second argument the output file name
3) Check the generated file
4) Removed all of your contacts from Google contacts
5) Import the output csv file to your Google contacts
6) Congratulations! you are now done.

Example:
  python modify_contacts.py <input file path> <output file path>
  ** Input my_contacts.csv and output is my_new_contacts.csv **

  python modify_contacts.py
  ** Input: google.csv ... Output: new_contacts.csv **

Note: 
1) It is preferred not to delete the exported contacts file before making sure
   that everything is OK and contacts are modified correctly, as in any case
   you can revert by deleting all contacts from your Google contacts and import
   the original file.
2) This script is tested and developed on nix environment, and running it on
   Windows environment is not guaranteed.
